# SuperLeagueChampionClient

This is a small Java project that gets a list of sports champions from a server and prints it in a readable way. 
The program asks for the server's IP address, fetches the data in JSON format, parses it, and displays the list of teams with their championship years and logos. 
It also shows the author's name who provided the data.

# How it works

The project has a few main parts:

- `Champion`: a class representing a single team with its name, year, and logo URL.
- `ChampionList`: a class that stores all the champions and the author's name. It can print the full list.
- `HttpHandler`: a class that handles HTTP GET requests to the server, retrieves the JSON, and converts it into `Champion` objects.
- `Main`: the main program that asks the user for the server IP, uses the handler to get the data, and prints it.

On the server side, a simple PHP script provides the data as JSON, including the author and each team with its championship year and logo URL.

# How to run

1. Compile all the Java files.
2. Run the `Main` class.
3. When prompted, enter the server IP (where the PHP script is running).
4. The program will print the author's name and the list of champions with their details.
