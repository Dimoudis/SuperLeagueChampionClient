# SuperLeagueChampionClient
Java client application that connects to a PHP REST service (getSLChampion.php) to fetch Super League champion data in JSON format. The client requests the server IP from user input, retrieves the data using Unirest, stores it in a custom class (ChampionsList), and displays the results in the console.
